Whether you're considering a virtual office for your startup or evaluating options for an existing business, this guide covers everything you need to know about the legal framework governing virtual office addresses in Singapore.

## Legal Foundation for Virtual Office Addresses in Singapore

### Singapore Companies Act Framework

Singapore's Companies Act provides the fundamental legal framework governing registered office addresses. The Act establishes that every company must have a registered office address but does not explicitly prohibit virtual office arrangements, provided they meet all statutory requirements.

#### Key Legal Requirements Under the Companies Act

1. **Physical Address Requirement**: The registered office must be a physical address within Singapore
2. **Accessibility Standard**: Must be open and accessible to the public for at least 3 hours during business days  
3. **Record Keeping**: Company registers and statutory records must be kept at the registered office
4. **Service of Documents**: The address must be suitable for receiving legal documents and official communications

### ACRA's Official Position on Virtual Offices

The Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) has not issued any blanket prohibition against virtual office addresses. Instead, ACRA focuses on ensuring that registered office addresses meet all functional and legal requirements, regardless of whether they are traditional offices or virtual office arrangements.

#### ACRA's Compliance-Focused Approach

ACRA evaluates registered office addresses based on:
- **Compliance with accessibility requirements**
- **Ability to receive and handle official documents**
- **Maintenance of proper company records**
- **Availability during mandated business hours**

This approach means that virtual office addresses are legally acceptable, provided they meet all operational requirements established by ACRA and the Companies Act.
